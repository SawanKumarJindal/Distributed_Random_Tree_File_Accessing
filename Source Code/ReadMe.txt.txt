In order to successfully compile and execute the project, we have to first log in the servers list
written in the filename "HashmapStore.java". There are two ways to do it.First is to create a bash 
script file which will log in to the servers list or secondly you can manually, run the servers. 

After running the servers, run the file named GladosFile.java which will ask about the name of the 
text file. After giving the input of the text file, it will create the hashmap of the list of servers 
associated to it and will send that file to the root and will search a random leaf value and perform the desired operations.
